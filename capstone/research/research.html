            <a href = "https://pudding.cool/2023/09/invisible-epidemic/">24 Hour Invisible Epidemic</a>
            <p>Invisible Epidemic analyzes how people go about their day and their exeriences. The side by side comparisions for the 24 hour invisible epidemic, it uses scrolling to convey information without overwhelming the user. Moreover, adding animation to each person provides visual interest without boring the user. The way the site visualizes data is really clean and the colors work well together.

            <a href = "https://pudding.cool/2024/03/teenagers/">This is a Teenager</a>
            <p>"This is a Teenager" compares data between teenagers and who they will become. Similiar to the 24hr invisible epidemic, it uses the scrolling to progress time and data. I liked this interactive website specifically because of the way they color coded the people when presenting the data, different from the 24 hour invisible epidemic. I enjoyed the data at the bottom at the website as dates, it's easier to follow in this format, which is something I want to add to my capstone project.</p>
