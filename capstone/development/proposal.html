    <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>
        I aim to explore the future of online learning, recognizing the evolving landscape of technology that offers vast opportunities for educational advancement. With the pandemic making online learning a temporary norm, many have voiced a preference for traditional, in-person education. My audience includes students, educators, and parents who are considering educational options and approaches. I plan on making this project solo.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe that speculative design and challenging mental models about in-person learning being the norm. With the advent of technologies like Apple Vision Pro and the accessibility of platforms such as DuoLingo, KhanAcademy, and the immersive experiences offered by the gaming industry, online learning can be more than just Zoom meetings and breakout rooms. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In my project, I see two individuals attending classes: one in a conventional classroom setting and the other maybe in virtual reality (VR). By integrating VR and augmented reality (AR) technologies, learning becomes more immersive. Virtual field trips around the world, simulated lab experiments, and interactive 3D models offer hands-on learning opportunities.  I imagine there could be issues with simulared labs and such as some courses must rely on in-person physical learning. I'm not sure if I want to focus on the future of online learning in a bad or good light as there is issues with online learning such as privacy and data collection, fear of children not being able to gain social skills due to everything being online, however, I can explore different ways that online learning could fix these issues and be better. I am a in-person preferer but maybe I can imagine an online learning experience that I would like more.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm also unsure of how to present the data if I want to show a compare and contrast of two different educational environments expecially with the whole VR classrooms which I don't think is super popular or have been explored yet.
