            According to a study published in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, around 64% of students who dropped out of college did so due to mental health-related reasons.
            Mental health issues are prevalent among college students, with about 39% reporting feeling so depressed that it was difficult to function, and 61% reporting feeling overwhelming anxiety within the past year, according to the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment.
            Student loan debt in the United States surpassed $1.7 trillion in 2021, with approximately 45 million borrowers, according to the Federal Reserve and the Department of Education.
            In the United States, around 60% of undergraduate students graduate with some form of debt, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics.
            About 43% of full-time undergraduate students in the United States work while enrolled in college, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
            The federal minimum wage for covered nonexempt employees is $7.25 per hour.
            The average annual cost of tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year institutions in the United States was $10,560 for the 2020-2021 academic year, according to the College Board.
            According to the College Board, students can expect to spend around $2,932 a month (or $26,390 for a nine-month period) on living expense. The average costs for housing alone is between $1,360 to $2,649 per month.
            Letâ€™s simplify the maths, if you were to work a $15.50 minimum wage job while attending college, your monthly paycheck will amount to $__ and 30% of that paycheck will go to towards rent.
