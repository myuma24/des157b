                    You’re a full-time college student with a part-time job that pays <span>$15 per hour</span>. This is California's minimum wage.

You feel extremely lucky you were able to get your own place for only $700 a month.

                With just a couple of clicks, the money comes into your account. It makes you happy to see $${money} in your account. You quickly pay this month's rent to the owner and make ends meet.

                Although you will temporarily have a little more money in your account, that money is debt disguised as savings. When you finish paying off that loan, you'll have given more than $500.00 to the bank, and let's not forget the student loans you’re already paying off.

                But you've already borrowed it. You may be able to take another loan to pay for the first one... 

                You decide to go to bed so you don't have to think about it. At least you still have your little apartment and you haven't lost faith that someday you’ll be debt and worry-free.
