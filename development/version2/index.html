                You arrive at your mom's house. As always, your mom welcomes you with delicious food, made with a lot of effort. You both have a <button id = "scene14Talk">good talk for a while.</button>

                After you're done eating, you insist on helping clean up, you know she's tired too.
                
                While you're getting ready to go back home, your mom takes out her purse. She hands you a $100.00 bill. She says "It might not be much, but I hope it helps you". You know that this is a big sacrifice for her, considering her own circumstances. Do you <button  id = "scene14TakeBill">take the bill</button> or do you <button id = "scene14DeclineBill">tell her that it's not necessary</button>?
            </p>
            <p id = "scene14P1v1" style="display: none;">
                Feeling a little guilty but you take the bill and thank your mother. You need it, and it's so nice to know she worries about you. She feels relieved for having helped you out. You give her a big hug and you <button class = "scene14Home">go back home</button>.
            </p>
            <p id = "scene14P1v2" style="display: none;">
                You thank your mother but tell her you're okay. If you ever need help you will tell her. She gives you a big hug and you <button class = "scene14Home">go back home</button>.

            <p id = "scene14P1v2" style="display: none;">
                You take the bus home. While it’s free for students, it was a long bus ride. After more than an hour, you're back home. You make your lunch for tomorrow and <button id = "scene14Cont">go to sleep</button>.

                You then get a notification on your phone. You have a text from one of your friends, “Do you want to get lunch with me tomorrow after class? My treat!”
                
                You contemplate the question. You’ll get a free meal but you are unsure how long you’ll be staying out and how you’ll get home. You also have quite a lot of assignments piled up thanks to the illness you caught a few days ago.

                You declined the offer of going out to eat lunch. You eat lunch by yourself, at least you’re all caught up with your assignments now.

                You ask yourself if you could've gone out to eat with them, but you're never sure if you'll make it to the end of the month.
                –
                You chose to go have lunch with your friends. 
                
                You like this restaurant very much. Your favorite dish costs $22. You check the menu and see the cheapest dish they have is a $12 sandwich. You may be hungry afterward but feel guilty for ordering something expensive. Will you ask for the <button>sandwich</button> or your <button>favorite dish</button>?
                
                You make your order and enjoy your lunchtime with your friend. While you feel a bit guilty over spending that much, it makes you feel a little less isolated to have lunch with them.
                
                You take a taxi (-$10) home and make yourself a quick meal for tomorrow. You think you should try to eat healthier, but vegetables at the supermarket are expensive. Maybe this weekend you should try to go to a market and buy some healthier food.

                You're focusing on your work in class. The atmosphere feels a bit tense but you continue your work. You overhear your classmates discussing not being able to keep up with the course load and they fear they may be academically dismissed for bad grades.

                After arriving home, you're still thinking about the classmate on academic probation. Your grades aren’t the greatest either and you think about what you would do if you were dropped from college. You hope to at least not get sick next month.

                Today you have work. You leave your apartment at the same time as usual to take a bus. For some reason, it has taken more time than usual to arrive. If you keep waiting, you'll be late to work.

                The alternative is taking an Uber, but you know that will cost you $10.

                After work you go to the market, that way you can eat healthier.
                At the market, there are many fruits and veggies you'd like to buy, but you know that if you take too many they might spoil. You take potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a few other things.

                You carry $40 in total of groceries. You'd like to buy some fruits too to have something sweet to eat at home, but that would make your groceries cost up to $47. Will you <button>buy fruits</button> or you will <button>only get the usual</button>?

                You arrive home with your groceries. You tidy up everything and <button>end the day</button>.

                You wake up because of a notification on your phone
                It's a message from your group of friends. They're planning something for today and want to try a place that just opened near one of their houses. You don't know the place's prices, but taking into consideration the usual prices of restaurants, you will be spending at least $12.000 plus your transportation needs. Additionally, you have a test tomorrow that is 15% of your grade, and should probably focus on studying.
                
                What will you tell your friends? Will you <button>go to the pizza place</button> or will you <button>tell them that you can't go</button>?

                You tell your friends that you don't think you can go and thank them for the invitation anyway.
                Some minutes later, you get a private message from one of your friends. He says that if it's because of money issues, he can pay your bill. However, you would still need to figure out transportation.
                You're moved by his help, but you also feel a bit guilty. You know your friend doesn't have that much money either. Will you  <button>take the invitation</button> or would you rather <button>stay at home</button>?
                
                You arrive at the pizza place and you meet your friends. You’re glad you went out. Most of the time you've been eating the same dishes every day, so it feels good to eat something different. 
                
                You try not to think about money and your test too much and enjoy the time spent with your friends. You finish eating and now it is time to head home. Do you:
                <button>Take Uber home</button>($10, 10-minute car ride)
                <button>Take the bus home</button>(Free, 45-minute bus ride)
                You arrive home, you’re tired but you use the little time you have left to study for your test.
                
                
                Even with your friend's insistence, you choose not to go. You wonder if you're overreacting, but you never know if an emergency might occur and you might need the extra money. Besides, you could use this time to study. You try to convince yourself that you did the right thing and day.

                you aren’t confident in how well you did but you did your best. Maybe you should’ve studied a bit more.

                After class, you remember that this week you have to pay rent. You anxiously check your bank account and you see that you have <p class = "totalMoney"></p> left.

                You get an email saying you have a pre-approved loan for $500.000 that you could pay up to 12 months in easy $43.93. Installments with an APR of 10%. You dream about all the things you could do if you requested that loan, but the idea of being in debt for that many months is scary.

                You think about it some more as you <button>go home to sleep</button>.

                After reading your emails, you notice you just got a mail about your natural gas bill.

                While you browse your phone you remember that you haven't paid your student debt this month.
                
                Student loan debt in the United States surpassed $1.7 trillion in 2021, with approximately 45 million borrowers, according to the Federal Reserve and the Department of Education. In the United States, around 60% of undergraduate students graduate with some form of debt, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. The average student loan payment is between $200 and $299 per month. For you, it is $150.
                
                In your head, you can hear the words that you were told during your teenage years: "If you study and get a college degree you WILL have a bright future!" You’re almost done with your college education and hope that this “bright future” will come to you soon..

            <h1>Thursday Day 25</h1>
            <p> 
                Today is the last day you can pay your rent on time, and you don't want to have problems with the landlord who has given you the opportunity to rent this place for such a low cost. You know that it would be really easy for him to kick you out and find a new tenant.

                You check your bank account. You have ${money} left and the rent is $700.00. Even if you waited for next month's salary (in 4 more days), next month you would have the same problem again.

                Even if you borrowed money from someone, you know you wouldn't be able to pay it back next month in full. The other solution seems to be to take the pre-approved loan of $500.00, but you'll have to spend the next 12 months paying it back in installments and if you lose your job, these installments could become unaffordable.

                You think about it a little since it's either that or risk losing your apartment... But you finally end up <button>requesting it</button>.
            </p>
            <p>
                With just a couple of clicks, the money comes into your account. It makes you happy to see <p class = "totalMoney"></p> in your account. You quickly pay this month's rent to the owner and make ends meet.

                Although you will temporarily have a little more money in your account, that money is debt disguised as savings. When you finish paying off that loan, you'll have given more than $500.00 to the bank, and let's not forget the student loans you’re already paying off.

                But you've already borrowed it. You may be able to take another loan to pay for the first one... 

                You decide to go to bed so you don't have to think about it. At least you still have your little apartment and you haven't lost faith that someday you’ll be debt and worry-free.
