            <h1>Observations</h1>
            <p>Users were able to easily navigate through the goals. There were some issues in the code that need to be fixed, but they did not heavily hinder the user experience. These issues were mostly related to text that was meant to be hidden but wasn't. The end result was relatively what I was expecting; however, some functions didn't run correctly, which I also need to fix.</p>
            <section>
                <h1>Updates</h1>
                <p>Users expressed that they wished they knew which options would affect their stats. I will go back and clarify this better in the text. Users also expressed that the scenarios were relatable, so I will not change that. However, I plan on updating the UI to make it more appealing and implementing images.</p>

            <h1>Test 1</h1>
            <p>
                I think the layout was very clean and crisp. I actually really enjoyed it. It was pretty classic but the educational feature was cool. It made me feel immersed in my own little reality. Everything was straight-forward. I wasn't confused and every feature felt like it had a purpose. It was obvious the game was controlled with the mouse because of the attention brought to certain words and phrases with the different colored rectangles. The controls were very intuitive and responsive. I honestly thought it was quite compelling. I think the different prompts were interesting, creative, and varied enough to not get boring. In fact, I got invested in the character I was playing and was curious how life would turn out for them. As a whole the project felt complete. It wasn't confusing or lacking in my opinion. There were a few bugs. There weren't any I noticed in the first half, but the second half there were some present ones. Nothing that got in the way. There were just some extra sentences in some places and I think sometimes money was deducted when it shouldn't have been? Not exactly sure. I don't think it particularly got in the way of the experience. It was still very playable. It felt very real. As a college student I go through very similar struggles. It was relatable and pretty accurate. The statistics provided were really interesting. I definitely learned about cost of living averages and general costs in california, and playing through almost a whole month at a fast pace definitely made me realize how much small things pile up if you let them. It was a good reminder to be budget conscious.

                "The highlighted words were helpfull to what impact it makes to me. There were no confusing features. The controls were very intuitive, I wish there was a message or graphic showing when my decisons led to a stat change.The storyline was very compelling and kept me reading.
                The content was not confusing
                There was a bug on a few days where dialogue appeared near the bottom of the screen.
                The loading time was instant.
                The realism of struggling to maintain balance in your life is relatable and made the decisions captivate me."
